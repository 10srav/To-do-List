## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### 1. MongoDB Atlas Setup
```bash
# You need to:
1. Create MongoDB Atlas account
2. Create a new cluster
3. Create database user with readWrite permissions
4. Whitelist IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0 for all IPs)
5. Get connection string
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Replace placeholders)
```env
# In your deployment platform, set:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_CLUSTER.mongodb.net/YOUR_DATABASE?retryWrites=true&w=majority
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://YOUR_APP_NAME.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=jezUUSpxEn0EkoPMfdzq60Pz+uf5Il/aqNXFjjsju70=
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_API=true
NODE_ENV=production
DEBUG_DB_CONNECTION=true
```

### 3. Deployment Platform Configuration
```bash
# For Render.com:
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Set build command: npm install && npm run build
3. Set start command: npm start
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

# For Vercel:
1. Run: vercel --prod
2. Set environment variables via CLI or dashboard

# For Netlify:
1. Set build command: npm run build
2. Set publish directory: .next
3. Add environment variables
```

## 🧪 Testing Procedures

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
# Test API endpoints locally
npm run test:api

# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### 2. Production Testing
```bash
# Test deployed API
TEST_URL=https://your-app-name.onrender.com npm run test:api

# Check production health
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/health
```

### 3. Browser Testing
1. Open deployed application
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Test user registration/login
4. Test task/event creation
5. Verify data persistence

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Solution:**
1. Verify MONGODB_URI is correct
2. Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
3. Ensure database user has correct permissions
4. Check cluster is running and accessible

### Issue: "API routes return 404"
**Solution:**
1. Verify build completed successfully
2. Check API routes are in correct directory structure
3. Ensure Next.js API routes are enabled

### Issue: "CORS errors"
**Solution:**
1. Check middleware.ts is deployed
2. Verify allowed origins include your domain
3. Ensure CORS headers are set correctly

### Issue: "Authentication not working"
**Solution:**
1. Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set
2. Check NEXTAUTH_URL matches deployment URL
3. Ensure cookies are configured for production

## 📋 Deployment Checklist
